<p align="left">Hello! I'm Isaac Nunez, I'm a software development student currently based in Winnipeg, Canada. With a strong passion for technology, I’ve dedicated myself to learning how to create efficient and user-friendly software solutions. My journey in tech has been driven by a fascination with problem-solving and an eagerness to develop applications that make a real-world impact.

As I continue my studies, I’m focused on building practical, scalable solutions through coding. I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and finding innovative ways to address them. Whether through individual projects or team collaborations, I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills in the ever-evolving field of software development.</p>
